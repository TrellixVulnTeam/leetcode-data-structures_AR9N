https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/

Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6

Notes:
-----


Solution: Sorted Array -> Linked List Conversion
--------
1. Initialize empty Array
2. Append each linked list value into Array
3.


Complexity:
1. for l in lists -> O(n)
2. for x in sorted(nodes) ->
