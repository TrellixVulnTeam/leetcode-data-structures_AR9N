    Stack

    Scenarios:
    1. Simple, 2[a]3[b] -> aabbb,
    2. Nested, 2[a3[b]] -> 2[abbb] -> abbbabbb,
    3. Nested + outer, z2[a3[b]]z -> zabbbabbbz
    4. Multiple digits, 20[abc] -> abcabcabc...

For each iteration, keep adding to stack until you reach "]". When you reach "]" continuously pop from stack and
build a string of letters until you reach "[". Once "[" is reached, skip "[" and pop again to retrieve the multiplier
in int(). Then update letters with letters*multiplier. Now if stack is empty, we know this isn't a nested scenario,
so we can append letters to result. If not empty, then add back to stack and continue!

Scenario 3 shows the possibility of having characters outside of the stack. To handle this, make sure to append to
result only when stack is empty.

Scenario 4 shows the possibility of having multiple digit multipliers. Make sure to update the multiplier and put
into stack as the FULL number.

    Time Complexity: O(maxK^(countK)*n) where maxK is the maximum value of k, countK is the count of nested k values
    and n is the maximum length of encoded string.

    Example: for s = 20[a10[bc]], maxK is 20, countK is 2 as there are 2 nested k values (20 and 10). Also, there are
    2 encoded strings a and bc with maximum length of encoded string, n as 2

    Example 2: for, s = 10[ab10[cd]]10[ef], time complexity would be roughly equivalent to
    10*{cd} * 10*{ab} + 10*2 = 10^2 * 2
