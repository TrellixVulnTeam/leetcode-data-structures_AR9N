https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens/
The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.

Example 1:
Input: n = 4
Output:
[[".Q..",
  "...Q",
  "Q...",
  "..Q."],
 ["..Q.",
  "Q...",
  "...Q",
  ".Q.."]]
Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above

Example 2:
Input: n = 1
Output: [["Q"]]
